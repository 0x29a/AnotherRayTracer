## TODO

1. Move material inside sphere structure, remove crap with access to material by index.
2. Add shadows.
3. Add png support (probably write handmade parser...).
4. Add `.obj` files support (with textures).
5. Add background support.
6. Antialiasing and all advanced things.
7. Rendering in multiple threads.
8. GPU-based rendering.
9. Probably rendering on gpu cluster.
